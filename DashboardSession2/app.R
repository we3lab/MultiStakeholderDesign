                                        Your years of industry knowledge will allow you to make quick and accurate estimation of the cost of wastewater treatment and transportation options.
                                        You know that due to the high capital cost of pipelines, trucks would be more economical, unless extremely large quantities of freshwater is required. 
                                        However, trucking will have much higher emissions when compared against pipeline options. There are three pipeline sizes available to you, with different pipeline capacity ranging from 200,000 barrels of water per week to 1,200,000 barrels per week.
                                        Each size also has different capital costs, ranging from $240,000 to $400,000. However, pumping cost is the same regardless of the pipe size, at $0.005 per barrel-mile, which is lower than the trucking cost of $0.053 per barrel-mile.
                                        Finally, you know that when compared against freshwater transportation, you will need to transport far less wastewater, especially if wastewater is reused for fracking or if it is sent to central treatment first.
