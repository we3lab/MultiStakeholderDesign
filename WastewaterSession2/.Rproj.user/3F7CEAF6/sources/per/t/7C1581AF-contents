Hydraulic fracturing fluid commonly consists of water, proppant and chemical additives that open and enlarge fractures within the rock formation. These fractures can extend several hundred feet away from the wellbore. The proppants - sand, ceramic pellets or other small incompressible particles - hold open the newly created fractures. The operation requires large amount of freshwater each day to sustain its operation, usually in the range of 240,000 barrels a week. The majority of this demand is fulfilled by first transporting freshwater from a local freshwater source (local river, creek, pond, or lake) to a centralized impoundment area, and then send it to individual well sites. In addition, wastewater is also generated during the process, and return to surface containing materials such as brines, metals, and hydrocarbons. A portion of it can be reused for future fracturing operations, while the rest can either be treated centrally and discharged to surface water or transported and disposed in disposal wells.",
